// Ballerina supports writing RESTful services according to the JAX-RS specification. 
// You can use `BasePath`, `Path`, and HTTP verb annotations such as `POST` and `GET` to
// constrain your service in a RESTful manner.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/http/index.html).
