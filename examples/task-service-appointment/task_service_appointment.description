// Task Appointment Services are used to schedule and execute tasks.
// An appointment should have an `appointmentData` field. It can be either a
// `string` representing a CRON expression or an `AppointmentData` record.
// An optional `noOfRecurrences` field can be used to provide the maximum
// number of times the appointment should run before shutting down.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Task module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/task/index.html).
