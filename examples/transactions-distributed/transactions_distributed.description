// To improve the reliability of microservice-based applications,
// a series of microservice invocations can be bound into a single unit of work.
// The underlying mechanisms are that of `infection` and `agreement` protocols.
// This example demonstrates the Ballerina distributed transactions protocol
// in action.
// Ballerina transactions are at experimental stage,
// please use the --experimental flag to enable them.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Transactions module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/transactions/index.html).
